# Data Visualization: Rock Climbing

A small project in visualizing rock climbing data. This project was part of the final project requirements for the Data Visualization and Data Driven Decision-Making course at the IT-University of Copenhagen in Spring 2022.

## Description

For an in-depth description of the project please see the accompanying [Report](https://github.com/dmdequin/DataVisualization_RockClimbing/blob/main/SubmittedFiles/Report.pdf).

## Dependencies

Jupyter Notebook and Python3 are required to run the notebook in the WorkFiles directory.

Additionally, the last two data sources listed under data below will need to be downloaded directly from OpenBeta.

## Directories

### Data

The Data is derived from [OpenBeat](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/tree/main/curated_datasets). 

Specifically the following files were used: 
* [Boulder_safety_and_Stars.csv](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/blob/main/curated_datasets/Boulder_Safety_and_Stars.csv) 
*  [CuratedwithRatings_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/blob/main/curated_datasets/CuratedWithRatings_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip) 
*  [Curated_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/blob/main/curated_datasets/Curated_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip) 

### SubmittedFiles

* A [report](https://github.com/dmdequin/DataVisualization_RockClimbing/blob/main/SubmittedFiles/Report.pdf) that has an in-depth explanation of the data, visualization choices, and goal of the project.

* A [powerpoint presentation](https://github.com/dmdequin/DataVisualization_RockClimbing/blob/main/SubmittedFiles/Presentation.pptx.pdf) that was used for presenting and defending the visualization choices of this project.

### Visualizations

Png Files of the three visualizations created in this project.

### WorkFiles

* A jupyter notebook was used for data exploration and to compute the average rating of climbs in the CuratedWithRatings dataset. This notebook was also used to compare data in the datasets against Mountain Project, the source of OpenBeta, in order to confirm accuracy.
