# Data Visualization: Rock Climbing

A small project in visualizing rock climbing data. This project was part of the final project requirements for the Data Visualization and Data Driven Decision-Making course at the IT-University of Copenhagen in Spring 2022.

## Description

For an in-depth description of the project please see the accompanying [Report](https://github.com/dmdequin/DataVisualization_RockClimbing/blob/main/SubmittedFiles/Report.pdf).

## Dependencies

In order to look into the files in the WorkFiles directory, Jupyter Notebook, Python3, Alteryx, and Tableau are required.

## Directories

### Data

The Data is derived from [OpenBeat](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/tree/main/curated_datasets). The [Boulder_safety_and_Stars.csv](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/blob/main/curated_datasets/Boulder_Safety_and_Stars.csv) and the [CuratedwithRatings_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip](https://github.com/OpenBeta/climbing-data/blob/main/curated_datasets/CuratedWithRatings_OpenBetaAug2020_RytherAnderson.pkl.zip) were both utilized for this project.

### SubmittedFiles

* A [report](https://github.com/dmdequin/DataVisualization_RockClimbing/blob/main/SubmittedFiles/Report.pdf) that has an in-depth explanation of the data, visualization choices, and goal of the project.

* A [powerpoint presentation](https://github.com/dmdequin/DataVisualization_RockClimbing/blob/main/SubmittedFiles/Presentation.pptx.pdf) that was used for presenting and defending the visualization choices of this project.

### Visualizations

Png Files of the three visualizations created in this project.

### WorkFiles

* A jupyter notebook was used for data exploration and to compute the average rating of climbs in the CuratedWithRatings dataset. This notebook was also used to compare data in the datasets against Mountain Project, the source of OpenBeta, in order to confirm accuracy.

* Two Alteryx files used to filter the data.

* Two Tableau files used for data visualization.
